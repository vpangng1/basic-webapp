# test-project

> A Vue.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install // this command is used to install dependencies/node modules for the project after bootstrapping the skeleton with Vue-CLI

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev // this command is used to start up the development server; you should see a new tab open on your default web browser with the project loaded. If it does not open, copy the http link from CLI and paste it in your browser

# build for production with minification
npm run build // this command will build and compiles all the files in the project and places them in the dist directory in the root of the project

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report // this command builds and compiles all the code in our project and places it in the dist directory in the root of the project. The --report also generates a report about the size of the files when they get downloaded or served to users 
```
